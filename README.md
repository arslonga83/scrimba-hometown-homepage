#Scrimba Hometown Homepage Project

https://arslonga83.github.io/scrimba-hometown-homepage/

The solo project from the end of module 2 of the Scrimba FrontEnd course. My hometown is about as boring as they come, so I made a page inspired by one of my favorite trading card games instead. 

Skills learned include flexbox layout and css hover effects.
